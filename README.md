### Hi there, I'm Panda - aka J3fftw1 ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Student that follows HBO IT study in The Netherlands. 
I work parttime as a IT repair/management guy.
I got some serious hate against Cisco, Programming, Microsoft, paper straws and Python like seriously why "and" and not "&&".

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [LiteXpansion](https://github.com/J3fftw1/LiteXpansion)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, PHP, Python, Cisco and many other networking tools.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding a meaning in life.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I mean anything you want just ask me about it
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on Discord, Panda.com#0806
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Panda
- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know Panda.com is worth 13 million euro
